- impedance control of shielding film for ffc connector is extremely difficult
	- complex stackup for shielding film (multiple layers)
	- need to get various parameters for insulating layers and conductive aluminium (alloy?) layer
- mcio connector and cables are rated for pcie 5
- occulink connector and cables are not very reliable at pcie 4
	- so expect a downgrade to pcie 3 for anything that is suboptimal

- stitching ground planes for shielding differential pairs
	- use copper filled vias
	- use staggered stacked vias (dont have a single via connect 4 ground layers)
	- lower stray capacitance

- via fence for coplanar waveguide
	- need to figure out a calculator that can handle this???
- 85 ohm differential, 42.5 ohm single ended
- design against 4GHz or 8GHz

- broadside coupled differential pairs will be susceptible to manufacturing tolerances
- differential coplanar waveguide for top pairs
- differential coplanar stripline
- use via fence to connect planes
