## PCIe electrical properties
- Function of RX and TX
- refclk
- clkreq and pulldown enable
- other control signals that need to be routed
- polarity of RX, TX can be switched
- order of RX and TX pairs can be reversed
- allows for more flexible routing in space constrained environment

## PCIe 3.0 specification
- maximum frequency requirement for pcie3
- bring up intel specification
- design challenges for reaching this

## PCIe 4.0 specification
- maximum frequency requirement for pcie4
- very difficult to reach without low loss dielectrics or HDI stackup
- less forgiving than pcie3
