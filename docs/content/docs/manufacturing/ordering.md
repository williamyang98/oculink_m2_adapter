## Components
The components for both the single board design and multi-board flexible PCB design are identical.

| Part | Unit Cost | Quantity | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amphenol Oculink port <br>(G14A42121B12HR) | $3.50 | 1 | $3.50 |
| SOD52 Schottky diode | $0.25 | 1 | $0.25 |

- Components were ordered from [Mouser Australia](https://au.mouser.com/).
- There are minimum order quantities for the Oculink port connector which has a MOQ of 5.
- Price of extra components are not considered since we are just interested in cost of a completed M.2 to Oculink adapter board.
