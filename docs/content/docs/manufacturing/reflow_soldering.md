## Equipment
- Reflow plate
- Soldering iron
- Magnifying glass
- Isopropyl alcohol

## Reflow oculink port
- Apply stencil for oculink connector, make sure there are no bridges
- Place oculink port
- Apply reflow

## SMD components
- Can apply stencil
- Easier to solder by hand

## FFC connector for flex pcb
- Need to apply pressure to connector while reflow occurs for complete contact
- There is not alot of tolerate for FFC connector when soldered since there is mechanical slack, it has to be as flat to the SMD pads as possible
- When reflowing connector place weights to apply even pressure across FFC connector
