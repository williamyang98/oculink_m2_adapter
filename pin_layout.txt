- impedance match fr4 microstrip with flexpcb microstrip
- flexpcb will have ground shielding around 
	- requires ground strip at ends of connector to solder shield to
	- use polymide stiffener at ends of connector
- flexpcb connectors are called FFC connectors
	- there are dual layer versions
	
- pin layout for m.2 connector
	- 67 pins : (34+33) = (5+29 + 4+29)
	- 14 ground (11+3)
	- 9 3.3v (6+3)
	- 8 rx
	- 8 tx
	- 2 clock
	- 1 reset
	- 1 clkreq
	- 1 pdet
	- 1 pewake (unconnected)
	- 2 clk+data (unconnected/reserved)
	- 1 led (unconnected)
	- 1 susclk (unconnected)
	- 19 unconnected
	= 67 pins
	
- pin layout for oculink connector
	- 18 ground (7+7+4)
	- 2 3.3V
	- 8 rx
	- 8 tx
	- 2 clock
	- 1 reset (perst)
	- 1 clkreq (cprsnt)
	- 1 pdet (???)
	- 3 test points (???): unconnected
	- 2 clk+data (unconnected)
	= 42 small + 4 ground
	
- pin layout for ffc (flat flexible connector)
	- 13 ground (7+6)
	- 1 3.3V
	- 8 rx
	- 8 tx
	- 2 clock
	- 1 reset
	- 1 clkreq
	- 1 pdet
	= 35 pins
	
- m.2 is pcie 4 x 4
- oculink is 4mm tall
